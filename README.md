# Legacy-Irrlicht-Multiplayer-RPG
An old Irrlicht Multiplayer RPG in which I contributed with with another programmer, and a designer.

It was created back around 2011 with another programmer. Instead of letting all of this effort waste away, I thought it'd be best to share. Unfortunately I was a very amateur programmer at this point and there aren't many comments, I would like to add comments and polish its functionality when I have more time on my hands. However, for now I hope it can help someone else especially if you use Irrlicht. I am unsure if any of the functionality present works in any newer Irrlicht version that may have come out in the last decade.
